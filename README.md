# Finance Tracker

This Python project is a simple finance tracker that allows users to manage their personal finances by recording income and expenses, viewing transaction history, and visualizing financial data.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Easily add new income or expense entries with date, amount, category, and description.
- **View Transactions**: Display transactions and summary within a specified date range.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize income and expenses over time.
- **CSV Storage**: All financial data is stored in a CSV file for easy access and portability.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main Python files:

1. `main.py`: Contains the core functionality and user interface.
2. `data_entry.py`: Handles user input validation and data entry functions.
3. `finance_data.csv`: Stores all the financial transaction data.

## Future Improvements

- Implement data backup and restore functionality
- Add more detailed categorization for transactions
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Implement budget tracking and alerts
